Create pure functions such as createRound(options), selectCard(state, cardId), tick(state, ms), and serializeProgress(state). Add support for difficulty settings (easy/medium/hard) that control card count and timer defaults. Keep DOM concerns out of this file so app code can consume it as a state machine.
