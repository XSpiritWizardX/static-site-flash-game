Implement seeded RNG from local date (YYYY-MM-DD), generate a deterministic board layout, add a Daily mode selector in the start flow, and persist daily progress in localStorage ({date, completed, score, streak}). Prevent duplicate streak increments for same-day replays, show a completion banner, and add a one-click share text output for score + streak.
